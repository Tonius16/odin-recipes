            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is a pizza made on a gas grill. 
                The results are great, and plenty of variations should work.</p>
            <p>The trick is to grill one side of the pizza dough first, 
                then add the toppings.</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ready made pizza crust</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
                <li>½ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
                <li>½ cup fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Roll out prepared pizza dough to a size that will fit your grill. 
                    Place on grill for 5 minutes, or to desired doneness, and flip over. 
                    Now add the sauce, cheese, green bell pepper and mushrooms.</li>
                <li>Cover the grill and allow to cook over high heat for 5 to 10 minutes, 
                    or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            </ol>
